# Codex Decision Log

## 2025-12-29T11:40:14Z (UTC)
- Decision: Create Codex-only documentation system under docs/_codex/.
- Alternatives considered: None (explicit instruction).
- Tradeoffs: Minor repo noise vs. strong traceability and governance compliance.
- Rationale: Required by governance to isolate Codex documentation from Claude-owned logs.
- Risks: None (documentation-only).
- Follow-ups: Keep logs updated per session; avoid duplicating Claude docs.
